## 🌟 Features

- ✅ aptamer design and optimization algorithms
- ✅ feature extraction from proteins and compounds
- ✅ compatible with `pdb` and `biopython`
- ✅ `scikit-learn`-like API - standardized and composable
- ✅ **AptaNet Optimization**: Tuning weights, optimizers, and RF selectors
- ✅ **Advanced Benchmarking**: Per-fold raw result extraction for `sktime`
- 🛠️ Easily extendable with plugins
- 📦 Minimal dependencies

NOTE: the package is in early development, API is unstable and not 100% features are complete - contributions appreciated!
